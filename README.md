Cannabis Classification


## Problem Statement
The problem statement is “To segregate the CBD Cannabis stain that is fit for medical purpose, best and others”.

The plant classification quality is required to be “best” in order to be properly processed for medical use and the others which are none, low, average, good. The goal is to accurately classify a cannabis strain as best or other. This classification would be based to features in the dataset like height, survival, branch form, vigor etc. The metric for evaluation is accuracy.
